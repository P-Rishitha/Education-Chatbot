# 📚 Education Chatbot (Mini Assessment)

This project is a **rule-based AI/ML educational chatbot** built in Python.
It was developed as part of a **mini assessment** to demonstrate the ability to design a chatbot capable of answering **15 predefined questions** related to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning concepts.

---

## 🚀 Features

* ✅ Answers **15 core AI/ML questions** correctly.
* ✅ Supports **common abbreviations** like `AI`, `ML`, `DL`, `NLP`.
* ✅ Handles **simple variations in phrasing** (via exact, substring, and fuzzy matching).
* ✅ Lightweight and runs in any Python environment.
* ✅ Interactive CLI chatbot loop.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Tech Stack

* **Language**: Python 3
* **Libraries**:

  * `re` → text cleaning
  * `difflib` → fuzzy matching

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Predefined Q\&A Bank** – Stores 15 essential AI/ML concepts.
2. **Shortcut Expansion** – Expands abbreviations like `ai → artificial intelligence`.
3. **Matching Logic**

   * Exact match → if user query matches a question.
   * Substring match → if a keyword is present in the query.
   * Fuzzy match → fallback when phrasing is slightly different.

## 💬 Example Interaction

```
🤖 Hello! I’m your AI/ML Chatbot.
You can ask me about topics like AI, ML, DL, datasets, overfitting, etc.
Type 'exit' anytime to quit.

You: difference between ai and ml
Bot: AI is the bigger concept of making machines smart. ML is a branch of AI that learns from data.

You: what is overfitting?
Bot: Overfitting happens when a model memorizes training data too well but fails on new data.

You: nlp
Bot: NLP is a part of AI that deals with understanding and generating human language.
