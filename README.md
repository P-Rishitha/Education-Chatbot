# Education Chatbot 

This project is a **rule-based AI/ML educational chatbot** built in Python.
It was developed as part of a **mini assessment** to demonstrate the ability to design a chatbot capable of answering **15 predefined questions** related to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning concepts.

---

##  Features

* ‚úÖ Answers **15 core AI/ML questions** correctly.
* ‚úÖ Supports **common abbreviations** like `AI`, `ML`, `DL`, `NLP`.
* ‚úÖ Handles **simple variations in phrasing** (via exact, substring, and fuzzy matching).
* ‚úÖ Lightweight and runs in any Python environment.
* ‚úÖ Interactive CLI chatbot loop.

---

## Tech Stack

* **Language**: Python 3
* **Libraries**:

  * `re` ‚Üí text cleaning
  * `difflib` ‚Üí fuzzy matching

---

## How It Works

1. **Predefined Q\&A Bank** ‚Äì Stores 15 essential AI/ML concepts.
2. **Shortcut Expansion** ‚Äì Expands abbreviations like `ai ‚Üí artificial intelligence`.
3. **Matching Logic**

   * Exact match ‚Üí if user query matches a question.
   * Substring match ‚Üí if a keyword is present in the query.
   * Fuzzy match ‚Üí fallback when phrasing is slightly different.

## Example Interaction

```
Hello! I‚Äôm your AI/ML Chatbot.
You can ask me about topics like AI, ML, DL, datasets, overfitting, etc.
Type 'exit' anytime to quit.

You: difference between ai and ml
Bot: AI is the bigger concept of making machines smart. ML is a branch of AI that learns from data.

You: what is overfitting?
Bot: Overfitting happens when a model memorizes training data too well but fails on new data.

You: nlp
Bot: NLP is a part of AI that deals with understanding and generating human language.
